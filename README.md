# Minesweeper
A remake of Minesweeper, written for SWI prolog.

# Quick Start:

### Linux:

Download/clone the repo and follow the usage instructions. Requires SWI Prolog: https://www.swi-prolog.org/.

### Windows/Mac:
No support at this time, correctly configuring Xforwarding on Mac OS may work. WSL2 with VcXserv has been tested to work.

# What's Cool About This Remake?

Our remake explores the feasibility of using SWI Prolog for classic games using the built in XPCE library. We use a randomly generated map and event listeners along with Prolog alarms to make the game work like the old classic game. 

# Usage:

1. Open a command line in the directory of the downloaded repo and enter the following.
2. ``` swipl ```
3. ``` [main]. ```
4. ``` run. ```
